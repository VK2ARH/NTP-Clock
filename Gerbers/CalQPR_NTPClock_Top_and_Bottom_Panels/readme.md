This directory contains the gerber files for the top and bottom covers to house the NTP clock in the PCB sandwich using the W8BH original BN33 board. The top cover opening has been designed for the 2.8" LCD Display. (3.2" display option now available).

There are two variants, one with the Manly Warringah Radio Society (MWRS) Logo, and one with the logo removed.

20th April 2025 _ I have now added a top cover for the 3.2" Display. This cover has been designed scaling the display area from a photograph of the 3.2" display as I didn't have a 3.2" display to measure, nor was I able to find a mechanical drawing which had the display area. I am confident that the display opening will be in the correct position accurate to around 0.5mm.
