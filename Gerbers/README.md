This directory contains the gerber files for the top and bottom covers to house the NTP clock in the PCB sandwich. The top cover opening has been designed for the 2.8" LCD Display. 

There are two variants, one with the Manly Warringah Radio Society (MWRS) Logo, and one with the logo removed.

The original W8BH gherber files for the BN32 and BN33 PCB's are also housed here. The housing that I designed and shown here is for the BN33 board.
