This folder contains documentation associated with the NTP Clock build - primarily to support the Manly Warringah Radio Society (MWRS) project developed by Richard VK2ARH. The principal build document for this project is **MWRS NTP Clock Build Notes v1.x.pdf** this should be read first.

This project is drawn from the NTP clock developed by Bruce Hall W6BH and a wealth of information relating to this project can be found on his website : http://w8bh.net/

Bruce Halls documentation specific to his original project consists of the following:
-  **NTP_DualClock.pdf** – Provides the background to the operation and programming of the firmware for the NTP Clock
-  **NTP_clock_build Instructions.pdf** – A detailed construction manual of how to build the NTP clock using Bruce’s original PCB provided for the project. NOTE: These are different to the MWRS PCB's
-  **CalQRP_Club_-_NTP_Clock_ReadMeFirst 2025-04-04.pdf** This document provides a series of guidelines provided to the California QRP Club who built the project in April 25 using Bruce Hall’s original project PCB’s. These guidelines relate to configuring the timezone for the USA, so read how to configure the Australian Time Zones later in this document.
-  **How to install the ESP8266 Board into Arduino IDE.pdf** The title is self explanatory. You will be uploading the firmware for this project to a WEMOS D1 mini microcontroller, and this document shows you how to set up the Arduino IDE environment to work with this board.
-  **VK2ARH NTP Clock Schematic.pdf** - it the schematic diagram used for the MWRS PCB
