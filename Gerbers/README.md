**Update 31st October 2025**
I have restructured this directory by segmenting the gerber files into their respective families
-  W8BH directory contains the original W8BH gerber files for the BN32 and BN33 PCB's.
-  CalQRP NTPClock Top and Bottom Panels contain the gerber files for the Top and Bottom cover developed for the BN33 board which was used for the CalQRP NTP clock project. The panels are available either with or without the MWRS logo.
-  VK2ARH Version 1 directory contains the gerber files for the Original project developed for the MWRS build event.
-  VK2ARH Version 2 directory contains the latest NTP clock boards which have added functionality compated to the version 1 boards. If you are looking to build the latest NTP clock, you should use these gerber files in conjunction with the VK2ARH Version 2 build notes found in the document directory.
