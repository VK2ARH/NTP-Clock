This subdirectory holds the code for the ES8266 to operate the NTP Clock. The Arduino IDE needs to have the apprporiate library loaded in order to upload the firware to the ESP8266. Details of how to upload this library can be found in the Documentation subdirectory of this repository.

There are two .ino files here for use with the NTP Clock - the first NTP_DualClock.ino is the original firmware provided by Bruce Hall W8BH. The second is the modified firmware which includes to solar indicies modification by Robert Kincaid AI6P together with the WiFi Manager functionality added by Simon VK2YU. I recommend that you use the second .ino file NTP_Dual_Clock_VK2YU_V1.ino . This version will create a wireless access point when there are no WiFi credentials in the NTP clock that can be used - there will be a blank screed after about 15 seconds if the NTP clock cannot find
